# Tone Analyzer

API with two endpoints:  

### A. Hotel Indexer
- A service with one endpoint to get the total emotional tones for a hotel, as described in the next step.
- Calculate the normalized total tones for the hotel using "Watson python libâ€‹".
    - For example, if review #1, for a specific hotel scored 0.25 angry, and 0.80 sad
    - Review #2 scored 0.7 happy, and 0.65 sad
    - Review #3 scored 0.2 happy, 0.7 angry, and 0.4 sad
    - So the total normalized tones for this hotel is 0.47 angry, 0.45 happy, and 0.62
sad.

### B. Hotel Tone Analyzer
- Index all hotels data using ElasticSearch
- Each hotel is represented as one document. Each review has its tones scores and the whole
hotel has its normalized tones scores.
